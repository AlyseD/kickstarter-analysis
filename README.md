# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this  challenge was to gain a deeper understanding of the trends of success and failure of Kickstarter campaigns using a wide array of data points, such as category/subcategory, amount pledged, campaign goal amounts, and outcomes. For this particular weekly assignment, we took a look at Kickstarter campaigns for plays and tried to assess how their launch dates and goal amounts could help predict their outcomes. 
## Analysis and Challenges
In general, the data shows that the most successful theater campaigns tend to occur during the spring months of April and May. This is also accurate when we filter specifically for theater campaigns for plays (as opposed to subcategories such as musicals, theater spaces). The highest percentage of failed play campaigns tends to occur during the month of August but improves again in September.  In regards to goal amount, the highest percentage of successful campaigns (hovering around 70-80% success rate) consisted of goal amounts under $5,000. Success rates were lowest with campaign goals exceeding around $45,000.

The biggest challenge during this exercise was ensuring that the formulas for Number of Successful/Failed campaigns was accurate, as well as organizing the charts to have the correct axis labels and values. With TA assistance, I was able to double check that the data I calculated was accurate and received guidance on how to create a more accurate chart. 
## Results
**Outcomes Based on Launch Date** The most significant data points in Outcomes Based on Launch date are the successful and failed campaigns, as there were no cancelled campaigns for plays. Overall, there is a percentage of success for play campaigns is higher than the failed rate. The highest success rate exceeded 100%, while the highest failed rate was about 60%. The latter never exceeded the former at any point during the year; however, it is clear that there is a spike the successful campaigns between March-May and drops drastically in June. The failed rate also increases in March, but does not reach its highest until August. 
**Outcomes Based on Goals** The goals with the lowest amounts tend to have the highest success rates (hovering between ~70-80%) with failure rates surpassing success rates at around the $15,000-$20,000 range.  While success rates increase again starting in the $30,000-$35,000 range, there are significantly less campaigns that were used in calculating this rate. 
**Limitations** 
In Outcomes Based on Goals, the percentage of successful campaigns is highest with smaller goal amounts, then dips and then increases again. However, there is a much smaller amount of campaigns that exceed the ~$30,000 range. If looking at the percentage of success rates only, it looks like the it's better to have a goal that is either pretty low or pretty high, but we would need more data for higher goal amounts to confirm this. In general, a recommendation would be to obtain more data for campaigns with higher goal amounts and/or ensure that all the categories that are being analyzed have a roughly similar sample size.
